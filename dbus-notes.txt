 DBus infrastructure
  handling properties, events 
  handling ObjectManager
  handling N-instances of same interface
  automatic introspection

 Dbus may seem foreign
  - We don't have to go fully crazy
  - There's a balance to trying to paper over it....

 Some of the initial patches may seem like overkill.

 DBus Introspection is XML
  - But we need to be able to read it from C
  - I've come up with a simple way 
  - codegen from XML to C

 Code generation
  - should always be treated with suspicion
  - in fact it's fine to hand craft these C structures to map the API
  - The code generation will give us compiler errors and warnings
    when the implementation code doesn't match the documented interface.
